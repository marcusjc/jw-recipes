#Apple and cinnamon breakfast bars
_Serves 9_
## Ingredients
200g rolled oats
* 70g coconut flour
* 90g vanilla protein powder
* 55g ground flaxseed
* 2 tbsp ground cinnamon
* 240g pitted Medjool dates (roughly 14 dates), chopped
* 220g unsweetened apple sauce
* 95g almond butter
* 70g coconut oil, melted
* 75ml boiling water
* 200g raisins
* 2 apples, cored and grated
## Method
Preheat the oven to 180ºC and line a 20cm x 30cm rectangular 
cake tin with greaseproof paper. Combine the oats, coconut 
flour, protein powder, ground flaxseed and cinnamon in a large 
bowl and set aside.
Put the dates, apple sauce, almond butter, coconut oil and 
boiling water into a liquidiser and blend to a smooth puree. Pour 
into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Stir in 
the raisins and grated apple then spoon into the lined tin. Using 
the back of a spoon spread everything out in an even layer then 
bake for 30 minutes until golden brown.
Leave to cool in the tin then turn out, remove the paper and cut 
equally into 9 bars. One bar is equal to one serving.
Tip
Wrap each bar individually in clingfilm and store in an airtight 
container for up to 5 days.
These bars freeze really well. Freeze them on a tray lined with 
greaseproof paper, then once they™re frozen transfer to them 
to a large freezer bag. That way they won™t stick together and 
they™ll be easier to defrost.
