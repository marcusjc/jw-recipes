Tip
This recipe uses ready-cooked lentils for ease and speed, but 
you can cook your own if you™d prefer. Pour the uncooked 
lentils into a pan of water, bring to the boil then reduce to a 
simmer and cook for 25 minutes. Drain then weigh out portions 
according to the quantity above. They™ll keep for up to three 
days in the fridge.
