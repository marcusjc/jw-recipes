# Potato pancakes with roasted  tomatoes
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients:
165g potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
* 80g cherry tomatoes
* Salt and pepper40g plain flour
* 15g protein powder, unflavoured
* 1˜˚˛ tsp butter
* 1 medium eg
## Method:
Preheat the oven to 200ºC. Bring a pan of salted water to the 
boil, add the potatoes and boil for 8˝10 minutes until tender. 
Drain then leave to steam and cool.
Meanwhile lay the cherry tomatoes on a roasting tray, season 
with salt and pepper and roast for 10 minutes until softened.
Mash the potatoes then stir in the flour, protein powder and 
plenty of salt and pepper. Work the mixture together to form 
a smooth dough then roll out into a disc around 1cm thick and 
cut into quarters. Heat the butter in a non-stick frying pan, add 
the potato pancakes and fry for 2 minutes on each side until 
golden.Poach the egg in a pan of gently simmering water for 4 
minutes until the white is set and the yolks are still runny. Drain 
thoroughly then serve with the potato pancakes and roast 
tomatoes.
Tip
Make sure you thoroughly drain the potatoes and leave them to 
cool completely; the drier the potatoes are, the easier they are 
to work with when you come to make the pancakes.
