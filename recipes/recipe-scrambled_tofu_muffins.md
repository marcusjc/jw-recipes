# Scrambled tofu muffins
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients:
1 tsp olive oil
* ˜˚˛ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
* ˜˚˛ red pepper, deseeded and sliced
* ˜˚˛ tsp turmeric
* 160g tofu, crumbled
* Salt and pepper160g baby leaf spinach
* 1 wholemeal muffin, split and toasted
* 20g feta, crumbled
## Method:
Heat the oil in a frying pan, add the chilli and pepper and fry 
gently for 5 minutes until softened. Tip out onto a plate and set 
aside. Add the turmeric and tofu to the pan and increase the 
heat. Fry for 3˝4 minutes, stirring regularly until scrambled. Stir 
in the pepper mixture and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Heat a splash of water in a large saucepan over a high heat, 
add the spinach and stir until wilted. Drain thoroughly then roll 
up in a few sheets of kitchen paper and squeeze out as much 
excess water as possible. Season with salt and pepper.
Top the toasted muffin halves with the spinach, spoon over the 
scrambled tofu mixture and top with the feta.
Tip
Tofu is a great low-fat source of protein. Look for the firm tofu in 
water, or if you prefer something a little softer then go for silken 
tofu. Whichever you use, make sure you drain it thoroughly first.
