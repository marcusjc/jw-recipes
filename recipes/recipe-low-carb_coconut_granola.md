# Low-carb coconut granola
_Makes 7 serving_
## Ingredients:
servings
* 150g rolled oats
* 95g mixed seeds
* 95g pecan nuts, roughly chopped
* 95g coconut chips
* 110g unsweetened apple sauce
* 45g coconut oil, melted
* 50g honey
* Pinch of salt
* 100g raisins
* 100g dried apricots, roughly chopped
* 75g yoghurt, such as Greek, natural or soya (per serving) 
## Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 160Â°C. Combine the rolled oats, mixed 
seeds, pecan nuts and coconut chips in a large bowl. Stir 
together the apple sauce, coconut oil, honey and salt in a  
separate bowl then pour over the dry ingredients and toss to 
coat.
Tip everything into a large roasting tray then pat down the 
ingredients to form an even layer. Bake for 20 minutes, stirring 
occasionally, until golden and crisp. Remove from the oven, stir 
through the dried fruit and leave to cool.
This recipe will make 7 portions so weigh the whole batch and 
divide by 7 to calculate the weight per serving.
Serve the granola with the yoghurt and store the rest in an 
airtight container.
Alternative ingredients 
To make this nut-free, swap the pecans for the same amount of 
seeds, such as pumpkin.
Tip
Kept in an airtight container, the granola will last up to 3 weeks.
