# Chargrilled tofu with quick  miso aubergine
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients:
1 medium aubergine, cut into wedges
* ˜˚˛ tsp coconut oil
* ˜˚˛ tsp sesame oil
* 10g ginger, peeled and grated
* 30g white miso paste
* 150g smoked tofu, diced
* 15g peanut butter
* 1ˆ˜˚˛ tsp sriracha chilli sauce
* Juice of 1 lime
* 20g spring onions, finely chopped
## Instructions:
Split the aubergine in half lengthways then use the tip of a small 
knife to score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not 
to cut all the way through to the skin. Lay the aubergine halves 
on a plate, cover with clingfilm then microwave for 5˝6 minutes 
until softened. 
Meanwhile preheat the grill to a high heat and mix together the 
oils, ginger and miso paste.
Rub the cut halves of the aubergine with the miso mixture, lay 
on a baking tray and grill for 5 minutes until golden brown.
While the aubergine is cooking, preheat a griddle pan to a high 
heat, add the tofu and cook for 2˝3 minutes on each side until 
lightly charred. Stir together the peanut butter, sriracha and 
lime juice then serve with the aubergine, tofu and spring onions.
