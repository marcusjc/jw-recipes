potato skins cut side up onto a roasting tray and bake for 10

spring onions and tomatoes and fry gently for 5 minutes until 
soft. Tip into the bowl with the sweet potato flesh, stir in the 
chilli flakes and chives and season to taste. 
Spoon the filling into the crispy sweet potato skins, top with 
the cheese then slide under a hot grill for 2Œ3 minutes until the 
cheese is bubbling and golden.
Heat the remaining oil in a non-stick frying pan, add the eggs 
and cook gently, stirring constantly until lightly scrambled. 
Serve with the loaded sweet potato skins.
