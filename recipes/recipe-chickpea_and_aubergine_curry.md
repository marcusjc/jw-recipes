˜˚˛ aubergine, diced

## Method:
Tip the aubergine into a bowl, cover with clingfilm then 
microwave for 5˝6 minutes until softened. 
Meanwhile heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, add 
the onion, garlic and ginger and fry gently for 2 minutes until 
softened.

Add a splash of water, the chickpeas and aubergine and cook 
gently for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir through the 
coriander and season to taste.
Tips
This recipe is great for batch cooking. Make double or triple 
the recipe without the coriander then divide into portions and 
freeze some for later use.
The best way to freeze the curry is to leave it to cool completely 
then spoon portions into individual freezer bags. Lay on a tray 
and freeze flat. By freezing the curry in a flat sheet rather than 
a solid block (in a deep plastic container) it™ll defrost far more 
quickly and also take up less freezer space.
