## Ingredients
35g self-raising flour
* 20g protein powder
* ˜˚˙ tsp baking powder

* 50ml skimmed milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Method
Combine the flour, protein powder and baking powder in a 
large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the egg, milk and 
vanilla and whisk until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk the 
egg whites to soft peaks then fold into the batter.
Melt the oil in a non-stick deep frying pan over a low heat, lay 
the ring moulds in the pan and fill with the batter (alternatively 
drop large, neat spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan). Cover 
the pan with a lid and cook over a low heat for 10 minutes. 
Remove the lid, carefully turn the pancakes and cook for a 
further 1˝2 minutes until set. Turn the pancakes out and serve 
with the peaches and honey.
