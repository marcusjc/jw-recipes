#Caramelised apple French  toast
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients
2 medium eggs2 tbsp skimmed milkPinch of salt
* Pinch of ground cinnamon
* 1 wholemeal muffins (2 halves)
* ˜˚˛ tsp brown sugar
* 10g honey
* ˜˚˛ apple, peeled, cored and cut into wedges
* 1 tsp butter
* 30g yoghurt, such as Greek, natural or soya
* 10g toasted flaked almonds
## Method
Whisk the eggs, milk, salt and cinnamon together in a bowl until 
smooth then add the muffin halves and set aside to soak for 5 
minutes.
Meanwhile heat the sugar and honey in a frying pan, add the 
apple wedges and cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, 
turning regularly until golden.
Melt the butter in a non-stick frying pan, add the soaked muffin 
halves and fry for 2 minutes on each side until golden. Transfer 
to a plate, spoon over the apples then top with the yoghurt and 
almonds.
Alternative ingredients
 To make this dairy-free, swap the skimmed milk for the same 
amount of another milk (e.g. soya or almond). The butter can be 
swapped for the same amount of coconut oil.
Tip
This recipe works best if the muffins are a little dry, so cut them 
in half the night before and leave on a plate or wire rack.
