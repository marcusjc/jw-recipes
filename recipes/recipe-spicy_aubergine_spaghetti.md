_Serves 1_
## Ingredients
1 aubergine, diced
* 1˜˚˛ tsp olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
* ˜˚˛ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
* 2 tsp tomato puree
* 150g tinned chopped tomatoes
* 1˜˚˛ tsp red wine vinegar

## Method
Tip the aubergine into a bowl, cover with clingfilm then 
microwave for 5˝6 minutes until softened. 
Meanwhile heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, add 
the garlic and chilli and fry gently for 2 minutes until softened. 
Add the tomato puree, fry for a minute then add the tomatoes, 
vinegar and aubergine to the pan. Bring to a simmer then cover 
and cook for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile cook the pasta according to the packet instructions 
then drain, reserving a little of the pasta water.
Add the pasta to the sauce, toss together then loosen slightly 
with a little of the reserved pasta water. Remove the pan from 
the heat, stir through the basil and season to taste. Pile into a 
serving bowl, dot the ricotta over the top and dive in.
Tips
This recipe is great for batch cooking. Make double or triple the 
recipe of the sauce without the pasta or basil (basil will turn 
black if frozen) then divide into portions and freeze some for 
later use.
The best way to freeze the sauce is to leave it to cool 
completely then spoon portions into individual freezer bags. Lay 
on a tray and freeze flat. By freezing the sauce in a flat sheet 
rather than a solid block (in a deep plastic container) it™ll defrost 
far more quickly and also take up less freezer space.
If you want to make this family-friendly, don™t add the chilli at 
the start of the recipe. Instead, sprinkle finely chopped chilli 
over the finished dish for those who like a kick.
