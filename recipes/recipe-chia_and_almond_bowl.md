# Chia and almond bowl
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients:
95ml reduced-fat tinned coconut milk
* 20g rolled oats
* 20g chia seeds
* 25g chocolate or vanilla protein powder
* 1 tbsp yoghurt, such as Greek, natural or soya
* 120g plums (roughly 2), stoned and cut into wedges
* 2 tsp honey
* ˜˚˛ tsp mixed spice
* 10g toasted flaked almonds
## Method:
Stir together the coconut milk, oats, chia seeds, protein powder 
and yoghurt and set aside to soak for at least 15 minutes.
Meanwhile combine the plums, honey, mixed spice and a splash 
of water in a small pan. Set over a medium heat and bring to 
a gentle simmer, then cook for 8Œ10 minutes until softened. Set 
aside to cool.
Pour the coconut mixture into a bowl, spoon over the plums and 
top with the almonds.
Alternative ingredients 
To make this nut-free, swap the flaked almonds for the same 
amount of seeds, such as pumpkin.
Tips
 You can make the chia and coconut mixture the night before. 
Chia seeds thicken as they stand so you may need to loosen the 
mixture slightly before serving with a splash of water.
The plums can also be cooked in advance and kept in the fridge 
for up to 3 days.
