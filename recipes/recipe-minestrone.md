## Method:
Heat the oil in a deep saucepan, add the onion, carrot and

and tomato puree, cook for a couple of minutes then crumble in 
the stock cube. Pour in the boiling water then bring to the boil.

the beans and kale and cook for a further 3Œ4 minutes until the 
pasta and sweet potato are cooked through.

serve.

tinned borlotti beans.
Tips
This recipe is great for batch cooking. Make double or triple 
the recipe of the sauce (without the cheese) then divide into 
portions and freeze some for later use.
The best way to freeze this dish is to leave it to cool completely 
then spoon portions into individual freezer bags. Lay on a tray 
and freeze flat.
