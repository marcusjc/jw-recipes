# Stuffed peppers
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients:
2 small red peppers
* 1˜˚˛ tsp olive oil
* ˜˚˛ red onion, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 small courgette, grated
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
* 65g cooked quinoa
* 20g protein powder, unflavoured
* Small bunch of parsley, chopped
* Salt and pepper55g feta, crumbled
* 60g yoghurt, such as Greek, natural, soya
* Small bunch of mint, chopped
* Green salad, to serve
## Instructions:
Preheat the oven to 220ºC. Cut the tops off the peppers then 
use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Lay on a roasting tray and 
roast for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onions, 
courgette and garlic and fry for 5 minutes until soft. Tip into a 
bowl, add the quinoa, protein powder and parsley then season 
to taste. Spoon the mixture into the peppers, top with the feta 
then return to the oven for 10˝15 minutes until the feta is golden 
brown; the peppers should be soft but still holding their shape.
Mix together the yoghurt and mint and serve with the peppers 
and salad.
Tip
As a rough guide, quinoa triples in weight when cooked. So 
for a 100g serving, it™s best to cook around 35g of raw quinoa. 
Alternatively, cook a larger amount then weigh what you need; 
any extra will keep in the fridge for up to two days.
