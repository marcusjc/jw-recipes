# Creamy mushroom and  asparagus pasta
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients:
50g fresh pappardelle or tagliatelle
* 100g asparagus, sliced
* 1˜˚˛ tsp olive oil
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
* 100g mushrooms, thickly sliced
* 80g tofu
* 2 tbsp low-fat crème fraîche
* 10g hard cheese, finely grated
* Salt and peppe
## Instructions:
Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta 
and cook according to the packet instructions, adding the 
asparagus for the final minute of cooking. Drain the pasta and 
asparagus, reserving a little of the cooking water.
Meanwhile heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic and 
gently fry for a minute. Increase the heat, add the mushrooms 
and fry for 3˝4 minutes until softened.
Whilst the mushrooms are cooking, put the tofu, crème fraîche 
and cheese into a blender and add a splash of the reserved 
pasta cooking water. Season with salt and pepper and blend 
until smooth.
Pour the creamy sauce into the pan with the mushrooms then 
add the pasta and asparagus. Toss everything together then tip 
into a serving bowl and dive in.
Tip
When you blend it in a liquidiser, tofu makes a really creamy 
sauce that™s low in carbs and fat but high in protein.
