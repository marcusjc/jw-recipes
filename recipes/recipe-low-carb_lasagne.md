# Low-carb lasagne
_Makes 4 serving_
## Ingredients:
servings
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 2 onions, peeled and finely chopped
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
* 700g Quorn mince
* 30g tomato puree
* 400g tinned chopped tomatoes
* Salt and pepper30g butter
* 30g plain flour
* 390ml skimmed milk
* 500g butternut squash
* 95g mature cheddar, grated
## Instructions:
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and garlic and 
cook gently for 5 minutes until soft. Increase the heat, add the 
Quorn mince and fry for a couple of minutes. Add the tomato 
puree, fry for a minute then pour in the chopped tomatoes. Add 
a splash of water, bring to the boil then reduce to a simmer. 
Cook for 15 minutes until thickened,  stirring occasionally. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile make the white sauce. Melt the butter with the flour 
in a saucepan then gradually whisk in the milk. Cook over a 
medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season to 
taste.
Preheat the oven to 180ºC. Using a very sharp knife, cut the 
butternut squash into thin sheets. Layer the Quorn mince sauce 
with the white sauce and butternut squash sheets, finishing with 
a final layer of white sauce. Scatter over the cheese and bake 
for 1 hour or until the squash is cooked through.
Tips
Use the thick neck end of a large butternut squash for this 
recipe (rather than the end that contains the seeds). You™ll 
be able to easily slice it into large sheets; a perfect low-carb 
replacement for pasta sheets.
To freeze the extra portions of the lasagne, first leave it in the 
fridge overnight. It™ll firm up as it cools, making it much easier 
to cut. Freeze in individual portions so you only have to defrost 
what you need.
