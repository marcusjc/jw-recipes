Tips
The best way to freeze this dish is to leave it to cool completely 
then spoon portions into individual freezer bags. Lay on a tray 
and freeze flat. By freezing it in a flat sheet rather than a solid 
block (in a deep plastic container) it™ll defrost far more quickly 
and also take up less freezer space.
