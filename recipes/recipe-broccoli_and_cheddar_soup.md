# Broccoli and cheddar soup
_Serves 1_
## Ingredients:
1 tsp olive oil
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
* 100g green lentils
* 100g broccoli florets
* 270ml skimmed milk
* Salt and pepper40g mature cheddar, grated
* 20g yoghurt, such as Greek, natural, soya
## Instructions:
Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the garlic and fry for a minute 
until softened. Stir in the lentils, pour over enough boiling water 
to cover by a couple of centimetres then bring to the boil and 
cook for 15 minutes. Add the broccoli and milk then simmer 
for 5 minutes until the broccoli is soft. Remove from the heat, 
season to taste then pour everything into a liquidiser and blend 
until smooth. Pour into a warm soup bowl, top with the cheddar 
and yoghurt then serve.
Tip
The best way to freeze this soup is to leave it to cool completely 
then spoon portions into individual freezer bags. Lay on a tray 
and freeze flat. By freezing it in a flat sheet rather than a solid 
block (in a deep plastic container) itâ„¢ll defrost far more quickly 
and also take up less freezer space.
